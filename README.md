# Home Automation

Small Ruby based project to automate stuff.

It's based on main.rb which calls modules. The idea is to have small files with single purpose. I call them modules.

* modules/wifi_check.rb - checks my WiFi connection to see if I'm connected to the correct network
* modules/internet_check.rb - checks Internet availability
